Ideas to borrown from pGraph:
- define timezone for specific machines
- define rules of conversion for CPU power, e.g. this processor performs
  20% faster than this one.


Ideas:

Instead of storing data in columns, which seems to be difficult and more
than a hammer on memory manipulation (close to 50% at data load time),
store in lines, e.g. each metric would have:
- a start time
- a period (computed and/or verified each time, croaking if too much)
- push data in the same table for each metric

Advantages:
- ease restitution if filtering for specific metrics.
- remove the need to precompute column index, as each metric would have
  its own table.
- less storage needed (no timestamps)
- possibly closer to R native timeSeries (ts) concept

Inconvenients:
- not the same baseline for all machines...
